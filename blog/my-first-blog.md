We are super excited to share the newly redesigned Ohmnilabs website which we developed with you in mind! 

![Good](/static/assets/dsc_1104pa.jpg)

The key goal of the redesign was to make it faster and easier to navigate, and to make it more user friendly.  In addition, we wanted to give you richer content, with insights into our production process, office tours, benefits of using our products, case studies and more!!



Not only did we refresh the design of our site, but we also added new verticals and products where Ohmni is being used. Key highlights include - 



* Early access to new products and announcements
* Introduction of new verticals, namely healthcare, education and business
* Behind the scenes view of what goes into building the Ohmni robot 
* Interactive product features section 
* Easy access to the Ohmnilabs App 
* And so much more.....
